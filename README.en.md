# WendaoIotPannel

WendaoIotPannel is an open-source general-purpose IoT system SaaS platform that provides complete capabilities for IoT device access, data collection, remote monitoring, and management. It solves the data link problem from device-side to cloud in IoT projects, enabling developers to quickly deploy their own IoT platforms.

This platform is developed by Wendaoiot and has been deployed in production environments across multiple industries, including smart water management, smart agriculture, smart aquaculture, and smart cities.

- Device-side uses standard MQTT protocol for access, without device model restrictions (device ID can be module IMEI, MAC, SN, etc.); Hezhou Air780EPM (LuatOS) is one of the supported models. Reference firmware is available in `hardware/`. Backend: Go + Frontend: Vue3/uni-app.
- Online Platform: Admin console http://pannel.wendaoiot.com/login | Customer H5: http://pannel.wendaoiot.com/iot | Docs wiki: http://wiki.wendaoiot.com ｜ Health Check: http://pannel.wendaoiot.com/api/v1/health

## Documentation

- [设备接入指南.md](./设备接入指南.md) (Chinese): device-side onboarding guide — connection params, uplink/downlink payloads, ping keepalive, OTA, D2D and error codes.
- [项目说明.md](./项目说明.md) (Chinese): architecture, multi-tenancy model, MQTT/HTTP protocol, device onboarding (per-device / per-product secret), online detection, OTA, D2D.
- [部署与测试.md](./部署与测试.md) (Chinese): local one-click launch, production deployment, configuration reference, EMQX/TLS, automated tests.

## Requirements

| Dependency | Version | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Go | 1.25+ | Backend build/run |
| Node.js | 18+ | Frontend build (tested on v24) |
| MySQL | 8.0+ | Business database (`wendaoiot`, utf8mb4) |
| EMQX | 5.x (5.8 recommended) | MQTT broker with HTTP auth/ACL callbacks, REST session-kick, 8883 TLS |

Docker Desktop is optional on the dev machine: [`deploy/docker/`](./deploy/docker/) provides a ready-to-use MySQL + EMQX Compose stack (secrets injected via `.env`).

## Quick Start

```bash
# Backend (:8080; prepare server/config.yaml from config.example.yaml first)
cd server && go run ./cmd/server/

# Admin panel (:3000)
cd web-admin && npm install && npm run dev

# Client H5 (:3001/iot/)
cd web-app && npm install && npm run dev:h5
```

Windows one-click local launch (Docker brings up MySQL+EMQX, configures the auth chain, starts frontend & backend): run `tools/local/up.bat`.
Default super admin is `admin / admin123`. For full steps, production deployment, and EMQX/TLS configuration, see [部署与测试.md](./部署与测试.md).

## HTTP API Endpoints

Base path `/api/v1`. Every endpoint except the public ones requires header `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. Roles: **SA** = super_admin, **TA** = tenant_admin.
